# CapitalAssetPricingModel

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. It's widely used for estimating the expected return of an asset given the asset's beta (i.e., its volatility or risk relative to the market), the risk-free rate, and the expected market return.

Here's the basic formula for CAPM:

Expected Return
=
Risk-Free Rate + β×(Market Return − Risk-Free Rate)
Expected Return=Risk-Free Rate+β×(Market Return−Risk-Free Rate)

Where:

Expected Return is what we are trying to calculate.
Risk-Free Rate is the return of an investment with zero risk, indicating the time value of money.
Market Return is the expected return of the market over the period.
β (Beta) measures the volatility or systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole.
